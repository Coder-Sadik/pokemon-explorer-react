# Pokémon Search & Favorites

This is a React-based web application where users can search for Pokémon, view their details, and add them to a favorite list. This project was created for practicing React concepts such as state management, component rendering, and hooks.

## Features

- **Search Pokémon**: Users can search for Pokémon by name.
- **View Pokémon Details**: Once a Pokémon is found, users can see detailed information such as their type, abilities, and stats.
- **Add to Favorites**: Users can add Pokémon to a favorite list for easy access.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Hooks**: Used for managing state and side effects (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`).
- **CSS**: For styling the app I have used tailwind css.
